/*
 *  This is an attempt of a spatial hashing structure intended for accelerated spatial queries.
 *  It makes some assumptions as it is not intended to be a general purpose spatial hash:
 *  - Only 3-dimensions (You could surely use it for 2D and 1D, but it would still do some redundant work)
 *  - Each cell can only hold up to 1023 entries, this is because the offset and length is packed into a single 32-bit integer.
 *      This implies the input data has a certain spatial distribution and the cell size is not too small.
 *  - The internal coordinates are compressed as 3x10-bit integers, which means there is some loss in precision. (Could change over time)
 *  - The cell size is currently fixed for simplicity. Could certainly change over time.
 *  - Internally works for periodic data as well as non-periodic
 * 
 *  Things to improve:
 *  Simlify implementation. The current version of using fixed cell size makes it a bit more complicated in the periodic case than it needs to be.
 *  Query should be handled with an external state object which can be used to iterate. The current callback is just cumersome and fugly.
 *  There should be an init function which should accept x,y,z + indices and xyz + indices
 *
